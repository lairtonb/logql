logQL is free, easy to install and extremely flexible data analysis tool. Easy to install: No database needed, no expensive hardware and logQL will run on any operating system supported by Java. Extremely Flexible: logQL employs a simple query language to generate the reports. Using this language, users can easily specify what data is needed in the report and apply filters on that data. For instance users may want to see how well a given product is selling? Then go on to check who the customers are? Is the demand increasing? Etc. Once the user has obtained the information needed, he/she can save the query to share with colleagues or to apply on a different dataset. The resulting data can be exported back to excel to analyze it further with pivot tables/chats.
