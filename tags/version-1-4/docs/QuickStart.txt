If you have Excel
=============================
1) Copy the Sample Dataset(above) Ctrl-C and paste it in Excel Ctrl-V.

2) Save this as account.xls (any folder)

3) Launch logQL by double clicking "logQL.jar".

4) Tell logQL the file to query on: 
      a) From the menu, select File > Open > Excel
      b) Select "..." and choose the file from (2)
      c) Click "OK"

           ** OR **

      Execute the following command:
        FROM <fillPathHere>/account.xls USE excel  

Now you can try some queries. See Queries section below

=============================
If you do *not* have excel
=============================
1) Copy the Sample Dataset(above) to a text editor and it save as "account.txt"

2) Copy the following xml to "acc-meta.xml".

	<logQLConfig>
	    <sepConfig name="sepAccount" skipLines = "1" seperator="\t">
		<field name="Date" type="date" format="dd-MMM-yy"/>
		<field name="Description" type="string"/>
		<field name="Account" type="string"/>
		<field name="in" type="number"/>
		<field name="out" type="number"/>
	    </sepConfig>
	</logQLConfig>

3) Launch logQL by double clicking "logQL.jar". 

4) Tell logQL the file to query on: 
      a) From the menu, select File > Open > Custom
      b) For File, click "..." and select account.txt
      c) For Config File, click "..." and select acc-meta.txt
      c) Click "OK"

           ** OR **

	Execute the following command:
		FROM <fillPathHere>/account.txt USE <fillPathHere>/acc-meta.xml

Now you can try some queries. See Queries section below

=============================
Queries
=============================

1) To see how much money was spent from each account
      SELECT account, out

   To get a pie chart, 
     - From the menu, select Chart > Pie
     - Click check box for "out".
     - Click "OK"

2) To check the day of week when the most money was spent
      SELECT dayofweek(date), out

3) Why is most money spent on Wednesday
      SELECT description, out WHERE dayofweek(date) = "Wednesday"

4) To check the day of week where money was spent on "Food":
      SELECT dayofweek(date), out WHERE account = "Food"

5) To check the break-up for account Food on Sunday
      SELECT description, out WHERE account = "Food" and dayofweek(date) = "Sunday"

6) To see all the individual items
      GREP date, description, out WHERE account = "Food" and dayofweek(date) = "Sunday"

7) To count how often you spend on cloths
      SELECT count(*) WHERE tolowercase(account) = "cloths"

Analyzing Apache log files
=============================

First, we select the file to query on and the file's meta:

    - From the menu, select File > Open > Custom
    - For "File", click "..." and select your log file.
    - For "Config File", click "..." and select meta.xml (part of logQL package)
    - For "Config", select "apache-common" or "apache-combined" 
      depending on your log file format.
    - Click "OK"

           ** OR **

    Execute the From command:
        FROM <file> USE  <congig>@./docs/meta.xml
    Example:
        FROM d:/logs/access_log.20060515.gz USE apache-combined@./docs/meta.xml

Now we are ready to go:

1) To see number of visitors
      SELECT count(host)

2) To see number of hits
      SELECT count(*)

3) To get number of hits per file
      SELECT path, count(*)

4) To see only HTML hits
      SELECT path, count(*) WHERE path like "%.html"

5) To see HTML hits refered by google
      SELECT path, count(*) WHERE path like "%.html" AND referer like "%google.com%"

6) To get breakup of hits, based on hour of day:
      SELECT hourofday(date), count(*)

   To get a pie chart, 
     - From the menu, select Chart > Pie
     - Click check box for "count(*)".
     - Click "OK"

To query across multiple files; you can specify the files seperated by commas,
 in the from clause:

     FROM <file1>, <file2>, <file3> USE <meta>@<configFile>

For Example:

    FROM d:/l/access_log.20060504.gz,d:/l/access_log.20060504.gz USE apache-combined@./docs/meta.xml

You can also use wild cards. For Example:

    FROM d:/logs/access_log.200605*.gz USE apache-combined@./docs/meta.xml
